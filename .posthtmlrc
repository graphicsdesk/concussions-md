In the years since the study, the NCAA has recorded over 5,000 concussions in 30 different institutions."

What was the context of it? Was it a practice? Was it a competition? Was it a certain kind of play?”"

A kickoff occurs at the beginning of a new drive, where the “kicking team” kicks the ball to the receiving team. The receiving team can then decide to run the ball up the field, often resulting in high-speed collisions. These collisions mean that this play was a big contributor to injuries overall, both concussion-related and not."

In comparison, the NCAA suggests that contact practices can happen as often as twice a week while in season. This move continued the Ivy League’s already stringent practice regulations, highlighting its commitment to limiting injuries."

The Ivy League-Big 10 studies have contributed to a greater understanding of sports-related concussions, findings that will hopefully prevent future concussions and lead to improvements in determining recovery times as athletes return—not only to athletic play but also to their full academic capabilities as students."
